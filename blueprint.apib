# zinc API Specification


# Group Overview
## Purpose
zinc aims to provide a simple REST API for managing AWS Route53 hosted DNS zones and zone records. It also includes a `POLICY_ROUTED` custom DNS record type which is translated towards Route53 as an AWS ALIAS record. This has been implemented in order to benefit from records inside the same hosted zone pointing one to another, thus adding the possibility of using an in-house load balancer.
## HTTP Methods
The zinc API makes use of the following HTTP methods:
* `GET` - **Retrieve** a representation of the requested resource
* `POST` - **Create** a new resource on an endpoint for all resources of this type. By POST-ing a new resource here we do not have any URI in mind for it, thus letting zinc assign one. The state of the new resource must be specified in the request body
* `PUT` - **Update** or **Replace** a resource at a certain URI by providing the new state of the resource in the request body
* `PATCH` - **Partially update** a resource by providing the parameters that need to be changed and their new values
* `DELETE` - **Delete** a resource at a certain URI
## Possible responses
Depending on the request being made, zinc will return one of the following status codes as response:
* `200` - The request has been successfully performed
* `204` - The request for deleting a resource has been successful
* `400` - The request body contains attributes that zinc does not know how to handle
* `401` - The request requires authentication
* `404` - zinc can not find the requested resource
## Resources/Entities
The entities that can be observed through the API endpoints are the following:
* **Zone** - The representation for the Route53 hosted zones. They can be listed all at once, listed per resource and modified per resource.
* **Record** - The representation for the Route53 resource record sets. Records can be listed within the zone endpoint and modified as a batch.
* **Policy** - The representation for the zinc policies. Policies can be listed all at once or per resource and modified per resource. Policies can not be created or deleted using the API.
## Limitations
Beside the limitations imposed by the [Amazon Route53 API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/DNSLimitations.html) and the [boto3 client](https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/route53.html#Route53.Client.change_resource_record_sets), zinc limits a zone to having a maximum of 50 records. This way it is assured that a bulk update on the whole DNS zone can be made through a single API call and atomicity is provided.
## Authentication
Authentication will be required for any and every zinc API request. Authentication process `TBA`.


# Group Zones
The zones created/updated/deleted through the zinc API are further handled on AWS Route53.
